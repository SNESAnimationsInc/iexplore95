# Internet Explorer 95 for Windows 11

Trying to make Internet Explorer 95 from scratch, using Microsoft's WebView2 and the Win32 API as the main components for this project.

It's free and open-source, so if you want to help me, you can use the code and add more features.

### NOTE:

There's a problem with the program, because when i installed the program and i try to open a webpage, it doesn't load the webpage and crashes. Can someone help me with this?
